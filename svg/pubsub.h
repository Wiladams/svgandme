		Topic facilitates the publisher/subscriber pattern.
		When you want to know when something happens, you
		subscribe() to a topic.

		Whatever is responsible for signaling the event
		will call the notify() function of the topic, and the
		subscribed function will be called.

		The Topic does not incoroporate any threading model
		A single topic is not a whole pub/sub system
		Multiple topics are meant to be managed together to create
		a pub/sub system.

		Doing it this way allows for different forms of composition and
		general topic management.

		T - The event payload, this is the type of data that will be
		sent when a subscriber is notified.

		The subscriber is a functor, that is, anything that has the
		function signature.  It can be an object, or a function pointer,
		essentially anything that resolves as std::function<void>(const T&)

		This is a very nice pure type with no dependencies outside
		the standard template library, and <functional>
